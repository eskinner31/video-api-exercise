#SCREENCASTS

Part of being a developer is contributing back to the community. One of the ways you can do so is by providing rich media in the form of tutorials to help other developers learn how to implement a new technology, or accomplish a certain task. Create a screencast walking through your Music-Player. Be sure to provide a demonstration of your working project. After you've completed the demo, walk through the different aspects of your code explaining the purpose and functionality of the different pieces of code. When you've completed the screencast, use the Video API and add it to your personal webpage. Take a screenshot, and slack it over to your instructor.
